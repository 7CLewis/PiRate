## Running Angular App
### Installation
To run the Angular App locally, you need to install NodeJS, NPM, and the Angular CLI (Command-Line Interface). [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a link to download NodeJS, which also installs npm. 

Once NodeJS and npm are installed on your machine, open a terminal and run the following command (in any directory):
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Execution
Now that all 3 components are download, open a terminal and navigate to `[this_project_root]/web-app`. From here, run the following 2 commands:

`npm ci` (installs the required modules for the program)

`ng serve` (runs the program locally)

### Access
To access the webpage, go to http://localhost:4200 in any web browser, and you should see the homepage.
